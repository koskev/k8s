# My little home cluster
Hosts a bunch of local services in my home

TODO:
 - Find a better solution for glusterfs
    - Kadalu seemed nice, but is just broken for me
        - Tried external and internal -> Both are just a hassle
    - Just use in cluster glusterfs with hostpath?
        - Daemonset client mount?
    - Ceph seems nice as well, but is probably overkill
